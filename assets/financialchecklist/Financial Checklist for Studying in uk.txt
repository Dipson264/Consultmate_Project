Final Verification:

Your funds have been held in the bank for at least 28 consecutive days before your visa application date.

The bank statements are recent (within 31 days of application), in English (or translated), and show the required amount.

All details on your CAS match your documents exactly (name, passport number, course title, fees).

You can clearly explain your financial plan if interviewed.

Remember: The UKVI is very strict about the 28-day fund holding rule and the authenticity of financial documents. Any discrepancy can lead to visa refusal.
